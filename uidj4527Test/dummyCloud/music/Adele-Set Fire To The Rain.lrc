[00:01.36]Adele - Set Fire to the Rain
[00:04.85]Edited by BYJ
[00:08.95]I let it fall, my heart,
[00:12.84]And as it fell, you rose to claim it,
[00:17.45]It was dark and I was over,
[00:21.85]Until you kissed my lips and you saved me,
[00:26.56]My hands, they were strong, but my knees were far too weak,
[00:35.42]To stand in your arms without falling to your feet,
[00:43.72]But there's a side to you that I never knew, never knew,
[00:48.57]All the things you'd say, they were never true, never true,
[00:52.77]And the games you'd play, you would always win, always win,
[00:58.70]But I set fire to the rain,
[01:03.60]Watched it pour as I touched your face,
[01:08.01]Well, it burned while I cried,
[01:10.19]'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name,
[01:17.87]When laying with you I could stay there,
[01:24.34]Close my eyes, feel you here forever,
[01:30.62]You and me together, nothing is better,
[01:34.92]'Cause there's a side to you that I never knew, never knew,
[01:39.68]All the things you'd say, they were never true, never true,
[01:44.64]And the games you's play, you would always win, always win,
[01:49.95]But I set fire to the rain,
[01:54.82]Watched it pour as I touched your face,
[01:59.06]Well, it burned while I cried,
[02:01.39]'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name
[02:08.02]I set fire to the rain,
[02:12.47]And I threw us into the flames,
[02:16.73]Well, I felt something die,
[02:19.06]'Cause I knew that that was the last time, the last time,
[02:25.89]Sometimes I wake up by the door,
[02:30.08]And heard you calling, must be waiting for you,
[02:34.54]Even that when we're already over,
[02:39.00]I can't help myself from looking for you,
[02:43.45]I set fire to the rain,
[02:47.70]Watched it pour as I touch your face,
[02:52.20]Well, it burned while I cried,
[02:54.89]'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name
[03:01.62]I set fire to the rain,
[03:06.02]And I threw us into the flames,
[03:10.57]Well, I felt something die,
[03:12.44]'Cause I knew that that was the last time, the last time
[03:19.62]oh~~
[03:23.86]Oh, no~~
[03:28.57]Let it burn
[03:32.32]oh~~
[03:36.77]Let it burn,
[03:45.67]Let it burn.
