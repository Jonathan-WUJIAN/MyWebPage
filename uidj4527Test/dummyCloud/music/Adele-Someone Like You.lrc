[00:00.59]Someone Like You - Adele
[00:13.71]I heard that you're settled down,
[00:20.80]That you found a girl and you're married now,
[00:29.40]I heard that your dreams came true,
[00:35.27]Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you,
[00:42.67]Old friend, why are you so shy?
[00:49.12]Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light,
[00:56.86]I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited,
[00:59.99]But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it,
[01:04.04]I had hoped you'd see my face,
[01:05.56]And that you'd be reminded that for me it isn't over,
[01:13.36]Never mind, I'll find someone like you,
[01:19.53]I wish nothing but the best for you, too,
[01:26.59]Don't forget me, I beg,
[01:29.99]I remember you said,
[01:33.52]"Sometimes it lasts in love,
[01:36.18]But sometimes it hurts instead,"
[01:40.63]Sometimes it lasts in love,
[01:43.01]But sometimes it hurts instead, yeah,
[01:51.24]You know how the time flies,
[01:56.77]Only yesterday was the time of our lives,
[02:03.78]We were born and raised in a summer haze,
[02:10.93]Bound by the surprise of our glory days,
[02:18.89]I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited,
[02:21.99]But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it,
[02:25.70]I had hoped you'd see my face,
[02:27.52]And that you'd be reminded that for me it isn't over,
[02:36.97]Never mind, I'll find someone like you,
[02:42.94]I wish nothing but the best for you, too,
[02:50.11]Don't forget me, I beg,
[02:53.46]I remember you said,
[02:57.31]"Sometimes it lasts in love,
[02:59.67]But sometimes it hurts instead,"
[03:05.02]Nothing compares,
[03:06.62]No worries or cares,
[03:08.62]Regrets and mistakes, they're memories made,
[03:12.21]Who would have known how bittersweet this would taste?
[03:24.00]Nevermind, I'll find someone like you,
[03:30.02]I wish nothing but the best for you,
[03:36.93]Don't forget me, I beg,
[03:40.37]I remember you said,
[03:44.01]"Sometimes it lasts in love,
[03:46.46]But sometimes it hurts instead,"
[03:52.13]Nevermind, I'll find someone like you,
[03:58.33]I wish nothing but the best for you, too,
[04:05.33]Don't forget me, I beg,
[04:08.81]I remember you said,
[04:12.46]"Sometimes it lasts in love,
[04:14.76]But sometimes it hurts instead,"
[04:19.47]Sometimes it lasts in love,
[04:21.92]But sometimes it hurts instead.
